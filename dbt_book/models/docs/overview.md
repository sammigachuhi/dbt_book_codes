# Learning dbt

Learning is not merely the acquisition of knowledge, but the cultivation of the mind. It is through the active engagement of our intellect that we develop the capacity for critical thought, discernment, and wisdom. By examining the world around us with curiosity and rigor, we uncover the underlying principles that govern its workings. This intellectual pursuit not only broadens our understanding but also equips us to navigate life's challenges with greater clarity and purpose.
